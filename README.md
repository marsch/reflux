# reflux

Describe reflux here.

there are several execution times:

* 1.) definition 1
* 2.) webpack - dynamic loading
* 3.) definition 2
* 4.) bootstrap - definition 3 (in the browser itself)
* 5.) the real execution of the code (in my repo by calling `run()`

the scope of the extension-points used here is 3.), 4.) and in rare cases 5.)
